# Update
Hey, this project was originally on my blog post <https://dev.to/lewiskori/user-registration-and-authorization-on-a-django-api-with-djoser-and-json-web-tokens-4kc7>

I've been improving on this concept of event scheduling and started a new project in another repo.
The code there is much cleaner and conforms to PEP standards(unfortunately I realized this one wasn't ðŸ˜…) but it's still functional.

If you are interested in viewing that project. I'll link the repos below.
It's a gym session scheduling application. It's utilizing google calendar API for ICS file generation and reminders.
The backend is in django and the frontend is built with vuejs(nuxt)
